# Mapping_Earthquakes
# Overview of the project
The overview of this project is to tell stories with data through the use of interactive maps.

# Resources:
- Data Source: challenge_logic.js,GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json.
- Software: VS code, Javascript, GeoJSON. 

# Results:
We were able create different branches that were finally all merged to the main branch. With the use of geographical features, we were able to obtain; 
- Points, which contains addresses and locations, like latitude and longitude coordinates, 
- Linestrings which contain coordinates for the boundaries of streets, highways, travel routes, and techno plates, 
- Polygons, which contains coordinates for boundaries of zip codes, counties, countries, provinces, and tracks of land

# Summary:
In the end, we were able to; 
- Create a bunch of branch from the main branch on GitHub, 
- Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch. 
- Retrieved data from a GeoJSON file, made API requests to a server to host geographical map. 
- Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and Data-Driven Documents (D3) library. 
- Added multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls. 
- And finally was able to render maps on a local server.
